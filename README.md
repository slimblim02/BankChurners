# BankChurners
A machine learning  project that predicts the attrition of a customer

Problem Statement

Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, is a significant issue for businesses, particularly in highly competitive markets such as financial services and banking. Customer attrition occurs when customers stop doing business with a company, which can result in substantial revenue losses and increased costs due to the need for acquiring new customers. In the context of this project, we aim to predict customer attrition using various demographic, behavioral, and transactional attributes.

Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers at risk of attrition. By doing so, the business can proactively engage with these customers to improve retention rates and reduce the associated costs of customer churn.

Objectives
Data Understanding and Preprocessing

Understand the dataset, including the characteristics and distribution of each feature.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Visualize the data to gain insights into the factors influencing customer attrition.
Feature Engineering

Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's performance.
Assess the importance of different features in predicting customer attrition.
Model Development

Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Train various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.
Optimize the models using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one.
Model Interpretation and Insights

Interpret the results of the best-performing model to understand the key drivers of customer attrition.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations to the business for reducing customer churn.
Deployment and Monitoring

Deploy the final model in a production environment for real-time prediction of customer attrition.
Set up a monitoring system to track the model's performance over time and update it as necessary.
